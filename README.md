## Notes

I used Bootstrap for quick CSS, since I found out about this CodePath course only a few days before the deadline to apply. I'm not very versed in php, so it took a while longer to get into the flow of writing in the language. Setting a default radio button was the biggest logical challenge, and I'm not sure if the if statement within the for loop to set "checked" is the most efficient way to go about it. Due to lack of time, I did not attempt to implement custom tip percentage.
